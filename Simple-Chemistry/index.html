        <h1>Introduction to Chemistry</h1>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>What is Chemistry?</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p id="">Chemistry is the branch of science that explores the composition, structure, properties, and changes of matter. It forms the foundation for understanding the world around us, from the air we breathe to the food we consume.</p>
        <div class="space"></div>
        <h1>The Atom: Building Block of Matter</h1>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>At the heart of chemistry lies the atom, the smallest unit of an element that retains its properties. Each atom consists of a nucleus, composed of protons and neutrons, orbited by electrons. The unique arrangement of these subatomic particles gives rise to the vast diversity of elements.</p>
        <div class="space"></div>
        <h1>Key Concepts in Chemistry</h1>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>Chemical Bonding</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Understanding how atoms bond together is fundamental in chemistry. Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons, while ionic bonds result from the transfer of electrons between atoms. These interactions give rise to molecules and compounds.</p>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>The Periodic Table</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Dmitri Mendeleev's ingenious creation, the periodic table, arranges elements based on their atomic number and chemical properties. It serves as a roadmap for understanding the characteristics and behaviors of elements.</p>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>Chemical Reactions</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Chemical reactions involve the transformation of substances into new ones. Equations depict the precise stoichiometry of reactants and products. Key concepts like catalysts, equilibrium, and reaction kinetics are crucial in this realm.</p>
        <div class="space"></div>
        <h1>Branches of Chemistry</h1>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>Organic Chemistry</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Organic chemistry studies the structure, properties, and reactions of carbon-containing compounds. It underpins the understanding of life itself, as all living organisms are composed primarily of organic molecules.</p>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>Inorganic Chemistry</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Inorganic chemistry explores compounds that don't contain carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds. This branch encompasses everything from minerals to metals and their chemical properties.</p>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>Physical Chemistry</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Physical chemistry bridges the gap between physics and chemistry, focusing on the physical and chemical properties of matter. Topics include thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and spectroscopy.</p>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>Analytical Chemistry</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Analytical chemistry involves the identification and quantification of substances. Techniques such as chromatography and spectroscopy play a pivotal role in this field.</p>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <h3>Biochemistry</h3>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
        <p>Biochemistry delves into the chemical processes within living organisms. It uncovers the molecular mechanisms behind life's vital functions, from metabolism to genetics.</p>
        <div class="space"></div>
        <h1>Applications of Chemistry</h1>
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
